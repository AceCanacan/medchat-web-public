## 📖 Project Description

MedChat is revolutionizing the way doctors and patients interact. Before a doctor even meets their patient, they can have a comprehensive understanding of the patient's concerns and conditions. Through a chatbot conversation, patients provide detailed information, which is then analyzed and can be relayed to the doctor. This ensures that even before the actual consultation, doctors are well-prepared.

### 🛠 Technologies Used:
- ReactJS
- OpenAI API

### 🚧 Challenges Faced:
- Navigating the intricacies of the OpenAI API, especially prompt engineering.

### 🔜 Future Improvements:
- Integration of an LLM (Language Model) specifically tailored for the medical field to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## 🔧 Installation
1. 📥 Ensure all prerequisites required by ReactJS are installed.
2. 🔑 Obtain a key for the OpenAI API.
3. 📦 Install OpenAI.

## 🚀 Usage

Post-installation, users can interact with MedChat through web browsers. Visual aids and screenshots are available to guide users through the app's features.

## ✨ Features
- 📋 Patient-Chatbot Interaction:
  - **Gathering Information:** The chatbot engages with the patient to gather detailed information about their condition.
  - **Analysis:** Post-conversation, an in-depth analysis is generated.
